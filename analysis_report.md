# Analysis Report

## Brand Image Risk
The risk I chose to analyze three different ways is regarding the brand image or reputation of each firm and any language that indicates a negative representation of the firm.
#### Mechanical
The risk was captured using the near_regex function which enables us to search for keywords inside documents with thousands of words much more efficiently where I searched key words such as brand image, reputation and searched for closeness to words such as change, impact, and damage. This helps us understand how firms view their name to be an important factor in their dealings with consumers.
#### Economical
I chose this risk as I believed it would have much volatility between firms as some firms names are so widely known that their brand image is one of the top priorities to protect. The emergence of Covid caused a lot of firms to figure out the safest and most effective way to serve their customers and show the world that they would be able to survive a global pandemic and their brand image is a crucial component to that.
#### Statistical
The firms with the most matches for this risk were PepsiCo(18 hits) and PNC Financial Services(16). While in very different sectors, these firms heavily rely on their name and goodwill with existing consumers.

## Supply Chain Risk
This risk felt like a good choice as supply is one of the major factors that was affected by the pandemic and very few firms had strong language about severe disruptions in their supply chain affecting their business model.
#### Mechanical
For this search, I used supply chain and paired it with disruption, interfere, upset, hurt, damage. These words capture the seriousness that a upheaval in the supply chain process would have on the company and product delivery.
#### Economical
This risk was specifically targeted at firms who have physical products that need to be shipped all over the world to satisfy demand for such goods. The impact that Covid had and still has on the supply chain issues globally is a severe issue.
#### Statistical
There is four firms currently tied for the maximum number of matches at 5, and these four firms are Home Depot, Idexx Laboratories, International Flavors & Fragrances, and Mondelez International, which are all firms that primarily goods.


## Cyber Risk
With Covid forcing the majority of people indoors and large amounts of time to spend on the internet. Businesses were forced to adapt to serve their clients in many different ways virtually. This could potentially lead to an increase in cyber risks as firms drastically shifted a lot of processes and strategies, such as working from home, that may expose sensitive information.
#### Mechanical
For this risk, I chose to pair cyber with attack and risk. This risk will capture the firms who were already exposed to cyber attacks and how covid could ramp up that activity against these firms.
#### Economical
With everything being stored in the cloud and most firms having a robust online presence, wether monetary funds or information, there is a lot at stake for these firms to protect their assets from the outside world. If exposed, this risk would do extreme damage on any firm susceptible to a cyber attack.
#### Statistical
The firm with the most number of matches is Huntington National Bank with 30 matches. With three other firms tied at 26 matches, these firms are Parker, Proctor & Gamble, and Truist.
